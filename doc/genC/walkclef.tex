Clef already contains built-in mechanisms so that
programs may traverse the Clef data structure.


Each Clef node contains a Traversal method.

I don't think that we'll be able to use the built-in traversal
routines.  But, we can use the Visit routines.  The traversal method
depends upon the type of node that we are currently processing.
Somtimes we want to do things before we visit the children, sometimes
afterwards, and sometimes we want to do things before or after we
visit a specific child.
