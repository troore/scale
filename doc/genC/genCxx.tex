We also have the option of generating C++ code.  The user specifies
C++ by creating a \code{Clef2Cxx} class rather than a \code{Clef2C}
class.  

Generating C++ is much easier than generating C for object oriented
source languages.  C++ has built-in constructs such as objects,
classes, and features such as exception handling.

We implement the C++ generator by creating \code{Clef2Cxx} as a
subclass of \code{Clef2C}.  We are able to use the existing code for
generating C and we only need to redefine methods which generate code
specific to C++.
