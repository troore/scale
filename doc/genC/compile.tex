\subsection{The Clef2C Include File}
\label{header}

All output from Clef2C inserts an include of a predefined header file
at the very beginning.  We define various data structures and macros
that Clef2C generates.

We must define the following data structures
\begin{itemize}
\item Complex Types
\end{itemize}

We also define the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Minimum
\item Maximum
\item True
\item False
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Clef2C Library}
\label{clef2clib}

We define a library for Clef2C programs which must be linked with the
object file generated by Clef2C.  We call the library libClef2C.
Users must add the flag {\tt -lClef2C} to the link phase.

The library defines the following functionality:

\begin{itemize}
\item exceptions
\end{itemize}
