\chapter{Generation Interface}\label{chap:genIf}

This chapter describes the \textit{generation interface}.  The
generation interface provides an Application Programming Interface
which supports the generation of an intermediate representation.  The
interface hides the structure of the intermediate representation from
the code which is calling the interface.  This separation of concerns
allows user code (code which calls the interface) to handle source
language dependent issues, and client code (which uses the generated
representation) to handle language independent or machine dependent
issues.  We use the term \emph{language parser} to refer to code that
handles source language issues, and \emph{user code} to refer to code
that directly calls the generation interface.  For this interface to
generate a particular representation, programmers must supply an
\emph{implementation} which provides the bodies for the
routines defined in the interface.  The code which uses the
resulting representation is called a \emph{client}.

We designed the generation interface with the following goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Souce language independent
\item Target architecture independent
\item Extensible
\item Support generation of high-level representations 
\item Fully describe original program
\item Prevent user errors where possible
\item Support C, C++, Modula-3, and Fortran~77, and consider
Java, Ada, and parallel Fortran variants
\end{itemize}
Though our design permits the detection of many invalid sequences of
routine calls, it cannot detect all such sequences.  In particular, the
generation interface is not intended to support syntax or semantic
error checking.  Source language issues must be handled before the
generation interface may be used.  The interface provides some
routines that allow the original program to be fully described, even
though the information provided by the routines is not strictly
necessary.  

\begin{table}
\[\begin{array}{cc}
\begin{minipage}[t]{3.0in}
User code:
\begin{itemize}
\item Syntactic and semantic error checking
\item Semantic resolution
\item Enumeration constant assignment
\item Insertion of explicit type conversions
\item Generation of unspecified brands
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} &
\begin{minipage}[t]{3.0in}
Implementation code:
\begin{itemize}
\item Memory layout
\item Initialization code generation
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
\end{array}\]

user code and implementation code.}
\end{table}

To support our goal of source language independence, we have divided
responsibility between the language parser and the client as shown in 
Figure~\ref{tab:assumptions}.  

The generation interface derives its language independence by
supersetting the capabilities of the languages which we wish to
support.  Hence, no one language is likely to need all the routines
defined in the interface.  However, implementations should implement
all the routines if possible.  If not, they are required to issue
appropriate error messages.

%Our design of the generation interface strives to be high-level and
%source language independent.  The interface definition attempts to
%prevent user (\ie programmers who use the interface) errors, but
%language independence necessarily forces the interface to accept input
%which is nonsense for any language.  In other words, the generation
%interface does not try to support syntax or semantic error checking.
%Ideally, the generation interface would be sufficient to handle any
%programming language, but our design focuses on C, C++, Modula-3, and
%Fortran, with some deference to Ada and Java.  The language used in
%naming interface methods is a half-breed of C++ and Modula-3.


\partitle{\clef\ Implementation}
Our implementation of the generation interface builds the \clef\
representation.  Our implemenation realizes the generation interface
as a C++ class.  The \clef\ class hierarchy does not include the
interface's class hierarchy.  This design point highlights the
separation of the interface from the representation.  Nevertheless,
many of the interface's routines end up being a call to a single
constructor in the \clef\ class hierarchy.

%The programmer should use a separate class hierarchy to define the
%node set for the generated IR.  The programmer must then provide an
%implementation of the generation interface in which the interface
%methods assemble an IR graph.  Many of the interface's methods may be
%simple invocations of a single constructor from the IR node set class
%hierarchy.  Nevertheless, the goal of this interface is to separate
%the code which generates an intermediate representation from the
%details of the represenation.

%The rest of this document lists the method calls in the generation
%interface's API.  Section~\ref{sec:decl} describes how declarations
%are handled.  Section~\ref{sec:stmt} covers statements, and
%section~\ref{sec:op} lists the supported operations.
%Section~\ref{sec:unit} shows how compilation units are
%handled. Finally, interface face options are listed in
%section~\ref{sec:opts}.
