			       ABSTRACT

This document describes the generation interface used to build the
Common Language Encoding Form intermediate representation.  The
generation interface is a set of function signatures which facilitate
the separation of a compiler front end from the back end.  The front
end must have semantically resolved the program before using the
generation interface.  The common language encoding form is an
abstract syntax tree representation with constructs sufficient for
representing several popular imperative programming languages.
