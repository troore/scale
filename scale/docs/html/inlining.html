<h1>In-lining in Scale</h1>
<p>
In-lining is the process of inserting the
body of a routine in place of a call to the routine.  In-lining is
performed in order to improve execution time by:
<ul>
<li>avoiding the overhead of the routine call, and
<li>constructing larger basic blocks.
</ul>
The disadvantage of in-lining can be compiled-code bloat and increased
compile time.
<p>
Several languages make explicit the programmer's desire to have a
routine in-lined.  An example is C++ with it's <tt>inline</tt>
attribute.
<p>
Java does not make in-lining explicit but, rather, makes it easy for
the compiler to accomplish it.  It does this through the byte-codes,
the stack oriented operations, and its edit-compile-test philosophy.
<p>
Scale currently deals with languages (C and Fortran) that have no
explicit provisions for in-lining.  However, in-lining can still have
some powerful advantages.  Some hardware architectures demand very
large basic blocks in order to be effective.  A typical C program
results in very small basic blocks.  The availability of in-lining may
allow the programmer to use a more <i>object-oriented</i> programming
style in C without suffering the ill-effects of the resulting small
basic blocks.
<p>
Scale currently does not have any in-lining capability -- but only
because no one has implemented it yet.  This raises the question of
how in-lining should be accomplished in Scale.  This document will not
attempt to answer that question.  Instead, it will discuss various
possibilities for in-lining in Scale.
<p>
<h2>In-lining Criteria</h2>
<p>
A criteria for picking routines as candidates for in-lining is
required.  The criteria chosen may have an impact on when that
in-lining may be performed.  If the criteria depends on metrics that
are only available at certain points, then the in-lining can not be
performed until the metric is available.  The decision on criteria
also impacts the information on each routine that must be retained.
For example, a certain criteria, such as <i>don't in-line if the in-lined
code is bigger than the calling code</i>, would require that
in-lining be performed after the instructions for each routine have
been generated.   Or, at least until a good estimate had been obtained.
<p>
Consideration must be given as to whether or not routines that are
candidates to be in-lined can also have in-lined routines.  If the
in-lining were performed <i>on-the-fly</i>, the implementation resulting
from allowing such recursion would be easier to accomplish using Java
code rather than C code.  If the in-lining were performed but once, some
ordering of the in-lined routines would be required.
<p>
<h2>Inter- or Intra- In-lining</h2>
<p>
The question naturally arises of whether Scale should in-line code
from other modules into the module being compiled.  Scale was built
with the idea of performing inter-module optimizations.  It has a
command-line switch (-M) that selects inter-module compilation.  What
this means is that after a module is compiled, information about that
module is retained while the other modules are compiled.  To date,
this facility has not been used.  And, it is not clear that Scale
keeps the pertinent information around from each module.  For
in-lining, the information required depends to a large extent on when
in-lining is performed.
<p>
Obviously, the disadvantage to inter-module in-lining is the retention
of this information and its effect on the memory usage of the Scale
compiler.  Scale is already a memory hog.  It was developed as a
research compiler and very little though or effort has gone into
making it memory efficient.  This memory in-efficiency is aggravated
by the fact that Scale is written in a language that uses implicit
memory management at run-time.  Inter-module in-lining would only make
the memory usage worse.
<p>
If only intra-module in-lining is performed, many, if not most, of the
opportunities to in-line would be unavailable.
<p>
<h2>Where in Scale</h2>
<p>
It is not a simple matter to decide where or when in-lining should be performed.
There are many possibilities.  Several  are discussed below.
<p>
<h3>In the EDG front-end parser</h3>
<p>
Scale uses the Edison Design Group C and Fortran parsers.  These two
parsers generate an abstract syntax tree (AST) form of the program called
the IL.  Intra-module in-lining could be performed, by the
<tt>edg2clef.c</tt> module of Scale, once the IL is formed.  The
in-lining would have to be written in C and the developer would have
to have a license for the source code of the EDG parser.  Intimate
knowledge of the EDG parsers would be required.
<p>
Inter-module in-lining could also be performed.  It would only be
necessary to keep the IL files for every module around during the
complete program compilation.  Doing so probably would have the least
impact on the memory usage of Scale of any of the possibilities for
in-lining.
<p>
The in-lining would not change the EDG IL representation of the
program but would generate the Scale Clef AST for the in-lined code as
part of the Scale AST for the routine that was being compiled.  The
implementation of this method of in-lining should be fairly
straight-forward.  It would have the added advantage of making it
easier to fix a current problem that Scale has with Fortran statement
functions that reference non-argument variables.  A disadvantage would
be the possible lack of information about the to-be in-lined routine
that is developed later by the compiler.
<p>
No matter where in-lining is performed there will always be the issue
of re-naming.  When in an AST form, actual variable names must be
changed as the routine is in-lined.  A mapping from internal-name to
external-name must be constructed.
<p>
<h3>In the Scale AST</h3>
<p>
In-lining after the routines are converted to the Scale AST would be
very similar to in-lining performed in the front-end.  A benefit of
this approach is that the in-lining optimization could be written in
Java and no EDG license would be required.
<p>
Scale creates an AST representation of the entire source code module
that is being compiled.  For inter-module in-lining the disadvantage
is that the Scale AST form of each source code module would have to be
retained which would adversely affect the memory usage of the compiler.
It would not be possible to use the EDG generated IL files.
<p>
A compiler module to do the in-lining could be called from the
<tt>Scale.java</tt> class method <tt>optimizeClef()</tt>.
<p>
<h3>In the Scale AST to CFG Conversion</h3>
<p>
In Scale the <tt>Clef2Scribble</tt> class is used to convert the
compiled program from the Scale AST to the control-flow graph (CFG)
form.  In-lining could be accomplished by this class in much the same
way as in the previous phase of the compiler.  The difference is that
instead of changing the AST, the generated CFG form of the program
would include the in-lined routine CFG.
<p>
<h3>In the CFG Optimization Phase</h3>
<p>
In this phase the structure of the compiled program is much more
complex.  As a result, the implementation of in-lining would be more
complex.  Contemplation of in-lining while in SSA form will likely
lead to severe headaches.
<p>
It would be difficult to load and store the CFG form if it were
decided to use files to retain the needed information about
inter-module routines to be in-lined.
<p>
There are no readily apparent
advantages to doing in-lining at this point in the compiler.
<p>
<h3>In the CFG to Instruction Conversion</h3>
<p>
In-lining the instruction form of a routine would be fairly straight
forward.  There would still be re-naming issues involving virtual
registers.  Each routine to be in-lined would have to be saved in a
pre-register allocated form.
<p>
Saving the routine to a file for inter-module in-lining would be
relatively easy; to over-simplify the description, the routine could
be saved as a set of tuples that contain integers representing the opcode
and registers of each instruction.
<p>
The main disadvantage to this method of in-lining is that no
optimizations, such as common sub-expression elimination, would be
applied to the combination of the in-lined code and the code in the
target routine.
