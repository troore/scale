<title>Scale Abstract Syntax Tree</title>

<body bgcolor="white">

Provides for the Clef Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) form used to
represent the source language program as closely as possible.  The
{@link scale.callGraph.CallGraph CallGraph} class is the container for the AST.  The
{@link scale.clef.Node Node} class is the base class for all nodes of
the tree.  The nodes are composed of {@link scale.clef.expr.Expression
expressions}, {@link scale.clef.decl.Declaration declarations}, {@link
scale.clef.stmt.Statement statements}, and {@link scale.clef.type.Type
types}.

<p>

The Clef AST is supposed to be language DEPENDENT.  That means that
you may have to define some additional Clef classes if you want to add
support for another language such as Ada.  Some of the Clef classes
are left over from an aborted effort to compile Modula III and C++.
Don't depend on any Clef classes, that not used for C or Fortran, to
be correct.

<p>

If you add classes to Clef, you will need to add code for them to the
scale.clef.Clef2C Clef2C} class as well as other
classes in the scale.clef package.

<p>
Each class, descended from the Node class, implements a
<tt>visit(Predicate p)</tt> method which calls the <tt>visitXXX()</tt>
method of its arguments class where <tt>XXX</tt> is the its class
name.  For example, the <tt>AdditionOp</tt> class implements

<pre>
  public void visit(Predicate p)
  {
    p.visitAdditionOp(this);
  }
</pre>

In this way the "visit pattern" is implemented and provides a way to
visit every node of the AST.  Several base classes are implemented for
the creation of visit algorithms.

<dl>
<dt>{@link scale.clef.DescendPredicate  DescendPredicate}<dd>which calls the visit method of each class's super class.
<dt>{@link scale.clef.ErrorPredicate  ErrorPredicate}<dd>which generates an error.
<dt>{@link scale.clef.Predicate Predicate}<dd>which is the base class of all visit classes.
