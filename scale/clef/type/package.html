<title>Scale Types</title>

<body bgcolor="white">
Provides for describing the types of expressions and variables.
The {@link scale.clef.type.Type Type} class is the base class for all types.
<p>
Most types in Scale are unique - that is, there is only one instance of a 32-bit signed integer type.
Because they are unique, the == operator may be used to compare them.
<p>
Two types are not unique: {@link scale.clef.type.RefType RefType} and 
{@link scale.clef.type.IncompleteType IncompleteType}.  These two types contain 
links to the actual type.
The RefType allows names and attributes to be attached to a type.  
For example, a structure name or the 
<tt>const</tt> attribute.  The IncompleteType is used for forward referencing as in a structure that has 
a field of type pointer-to its own type.
<p>
All classes that that require type information such as 
{@link scale.clef.expr.Expression expressions} 
and {@link scale.clef.decl.Declaration declarations} support two methods:
<dl>
<dt>getType()<dd>return the type of the object, and
<dt>getCoreType()<dd>return the "core type" of the object.
</dl>
The difference between these two methods is that <tt>getCoreType()</tt> returns the most basic type.
That is, if the type is modified by a name or attribute, or if it was originally incomplete, 
<tt>getCoreType()<tt> accesses the un-modified base type.  For example, for
<pre>
  typedef int int32;
  const int32 x;
</pre>
<tt>getCoreType()</tt> applied to the variable <tt>x</tt> would return the type instance for
an <tt>int</tt>.
<p>
It is very important to use the correct method.  For example, for
<pre>
  typedef int int32a;
  const int32a x;
  typedef int int32b;
  const int32b y;
</pre>
the types returned by <tt>getType</tt> for <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> would not be identical.
However, the types returned by <tt>getCoreType</tt> would be identical.
