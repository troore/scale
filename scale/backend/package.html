Generates assembly language output from the {@link
scale.score.Scribble CFG} representation of a program.

<p>
The Scale compiler uses object-oriented programming techniques to make
the implementation of code generators for different ISAs straight
forward.  Thus far, code generators for Sparc, Alpha, PowerPC, and Mips
processors have been implemented.
<p>

A base class for the code generator contains the basic logic to
transform {@link scale.score.Scribble Scribble} CFG nodes into
instructions.  Each derived code generator class implements virtual
methods that the base class uses to perform specific actions such as
transforming a real value to an integer value or loading a register
from memory.  As the Scale compiler generates assembly code and uses
the native assembler to generate object modules, there is a base class
for generating the assembly code from which specific assembly code
generators must be derived.

<p>

Each ISA has different instructions.  Each ISA-specific instruction
format is represented by a different class that is derived from the
same {@link scale.backend.Instruction instruction base class}.  So
that the base code generator class can manage the representation of
branch points, all {@link scale.backend.Branch branch instructions}
are derived from the same class that is also derived from the base
instruction class.  For example, the following is a simplified example
class hierarchy for the Alpha instructions:
<pre>
 Instruction <- MemoryInstruction <- LoadInstruction
                                  <- StoreInstruction
                                  <- LoadAddressInstruction
                                  <- BarriorInstruction
                                  <- FetchInstruction
             <- IntOpInstruction
             <- IntOpLitInstruction
             <- FltOpInstruction <- FltCvtInstruction

             <- Branch <- BranchInstruction
                       <- JmpInstruction
</pre>

For the Sparc V8 processor a more simplified example hierarchy is:
<pre>
  Instruction <- SparcInstruction <- LoadInstruction
                                  <- LoadLitInstruction
                                  <- StoreInstruction
                                  <- StoreLitInstruction
                                  <- SethiInstruction
                                  <- IntOpInstruction
                                  <- IntOpLitInstruction
                                  <- FltOpInstruction
                                  <- FltOp2Instruction
                                  <- FltCmpInstruction

              <- Branch <- SparcBranch <- BranchCCInstruction
                                       <- BranchInstruction
                                       <- CallInstruction
                                       <- JmplInstruction
                                       <- JmplLitInstruction
</pre>

Virtual methods are used to implement the methods required from the
instruction class by the other parts of the backend.  Register
allocation, described below, is a good example of how these virtual
methods are used.

<p>

Some numbers will illustrate how the object-oriented approach has
worked.  The generic base classes comprise some 3600 non-blank,
non-comment lines of Java code.  The Alpha specific code is 6600
non-blank, non-comment lines of Java code.  The Sparc specific code is
10,800 non-blank, non-comment lines of Java code.  The Mips specific
code is 5900 non-blank, non-comment lines of Java code.  The generic
classes and the Alpha specific classes required approximately two
man-months to implement. The Sparc specific classes also took two
man-months.  The Mips classes where written by an undergraduate in
less than two months.  The major complication of the Sparc
implementation was designing and implementing multi-register values
for the Sparc V8 processor and the large number of different
instruction formats; the register-window design of the Sparc processor
required only four lines of Java code.

<h3>{@link scale.backend.RegisterAllocator Register Allocation Example}</h3>

Object-oriented programming techniques make the inclusion of
different register allocators a relatively simple matter.  Two
different concepts represented by two different base classes are the
basis of register allocation.

<p>

The first is the concept of a register set and is similar to the ideas
used in the Gnu C compiler.  In Scale, registers are represented by
integers.  The {@link scale.backend.RegisterSet register set base
class} specifies operations on those integers.  There is a different
derived class, that specifies particulars of the register set, defined
for each ISA.  Registers are either real or virtual with the first <tt>n</tt>
registers representing the real registers of the ISA.

<p>

The {@link scale.backend.RegisterAllocator second base class}
represents the basics of register allocation.  It includes the methods
needed to describe the register usage for a program and the live
register analysis required by every register allocation algorithm.
The Scale compiler uses the concept of an infinite register set while
generating the instructions.  The register allocator derived classes
implement the algorithms needed to map these virtual registers to the
real registers of a specific ISA.  These register allocator classes
are ISA independent.

<p>

The integer value representing a register is used as an index into an
array where each array element describes the corresponding register.
Each register has attributes that describe what type of values that
register may hold.  For virtual registers these attributes are used to
specify if this register is part of a multi-register set.  This can be
used to specify that the value spans two or more contiguous registers
(e.g., 64-bit integers for a 32-bit ISA) or that the value is made up
of two separable values (e.g., complex values).

<p>

During the live analysis, instructions are <i>linearized</i> so that
each instruction can be represented, and accessed, by an integer
value.  Each instruction is visited to generate the needed register
usage information.  Each instruction class implements a method ({@link
scale.backend.Instruction#specifyRegisterUsage specifyRegisterUsage})
that the register allocator calls, passing itself in as an argument to
the method.  Special, non-code-generating instructions ({@link
scale.backend.Marker markers}) are inserted by the code generators to
specify register usage over subroutine calls.

<p>

The register allocator base class implements three methods that the
instruction class's specifyRegisterUsage method calls.  The first
method is used to specify, by integer value, the real or virtual
registers whose values the instruction requires.  The second method
specifies the registers whose values are generated by the instruction.
The third method specifies the registers that are modified (clobbered)
by an instruction.  The result of this is a set of three bit-arrays
indexed by instruction index and register index.  Liveness is computed
from this and the result array is transposed to produce an array of
bit vectors indexed by the register's integer representation.

<p>

Register spilling is also ISA independent.  Each machine dependent
code generator implements three methods.  The first method is used by
the register allocator to obtain an opaque location
specifier (usually on the stack) into which a
register may be spilled.  The second method is used by the register
allocator to cause the code generator to insert a store of a register
to a spill location and the third method is used to reload the
register.  The second and third methods are passed: the opaque
location specifier, the register, and the place in the instruction
stream to insert the operation.  If any registers are spilled, the
current allocation of virtual registers to real registers is discarded
and register allocation is performed again.

<h3>Adding a New Code Generator</h3>

Scale is set up so that it does not need to know what code generators
are available.  It uses the Java reflection capability to find the
code generator specified.  There are two ways a code generator is
specified:

<ol>
<li>The <code>-arch</code> command line parameter is used to specify the target architecture.
<li>The host architecture specified by <code>System.getProperty("os.arch")</code> is used.
</ol>

Using replection, Scale tries to load a class named
<code>scale.backend.arch.ArchGenerator.class</code> where <code>arch
is the name of the architecture obtained as specified above.  (Note
that Java class names must start with a capital letter but
architectures are specified in all lower-case letters.)  For example,
on an Alpha&reg;, the class {@link scale.backend.alpha.AlphaGenerator
scale.backend.alpha.AlphaGenerator} class</code> is loaded.
<p>
Scale must also be able to find a class name
<code>scale.backend.arch.ArchMachine.  This class specifies attributes
of the architecture, such as word size, that are needed prior to code
generation. For example, on an Alpha&reg;, the {@link
scale.backend.alpha.AlphaMachine scale.backend.alpha.AlphaMachine}
class</code> is loaded.

<p>
To add these two classes, and any others required, add a new directory
to the scale/backend directory whose name is the architecture name and
place the classes in it.  (You can use the <code>xyz</code> directory
to obtain template classes for the four required classes.)

<p>
The code generator class must be derived from the {@link
scale.backend.Generator scale.backend.Generator} class and the machine
class must be derived from {@link scale.common.Machine
scale.common.Machine} class. Use the other code generators as a guide in
building a new one.  Keep in mind that the design for the code
generators assumed a register load/operate/store (RISC) model;
building a code generator for a CISC-type architecture may prove to be
much more difficult.
<p>

If there are multiple variants on the same architecture (e.g., SparcV8
& SparcV9), modifications may be required to the {@link
scale.common.Machine#setup scale.common.Machine setup()} method.  You
may also add extensions as in <code>-arch alpha/bwx</code>.  These
<i>extensions</i> are passed to the {@link
scale.common.Machine#determineArchitecture scale.common.Machine
determineArchitecture()} method.

<p>
The classes defined for the architecture's instructions must be
derived from the {@link scale.backend.Instruction scale.backend
Instruction} class.  Any branch instruction must be derived from the
{@link scale.backend.Branch scale.backend Branch} class.
