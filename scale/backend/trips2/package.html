The Trips backend for the Scale compiler generates Trips Intermediate
Language (TIL) files for the <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/cart/trips/">Trips processor</a>
from the Scale {@link scale.score.Scribble CFG}.  These files are then
read by the Trips scheduler which schedules the instructions to the
processors on the grid.  It is the Trips scheduler that actually
outputs Trips assembly language files.
