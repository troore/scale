This is a description of how we include alias information into our
{@link scale.score.SSA SSA} representation.  

<p>

Our baseline technique for including alias information in SSA form is
described in the paper by Chow et. al.  It helps to understand this
paper to understand our extensions.  First wesummarize Chow's solution
to incorporating alias information in SSA form .  Then, we will
discuss our extensions.

<p>

The main contribution by Chow et. al. is the use of virtual variables
to represent indirect operations which unifies the treatment of
indirect and scalar variables for SSA analyses and optimizations.  The
treatment of aliases is based upon the work by Choi et. al. which
distinguishes between {@link scale.score.analyses.MayDef MayDefs}
(preserving definitions or weak updates) and {@link
scale.score.analyses.MayUse MayUses}.  Chow et. al. add Chi and Mu
operators to model MayDef and MayUse effects, respectively.  The Chi
and Mu operators work on virtual variables rather than scalar
variables.  Thus, a definition (Chi) of a virtual variable is a
definition of a group of actual variables that share similar alias
characteristics.  Correspondingly, a Mu operator represents a use.

<p>

A {@link scale.score.analyses.VirtualVar virtual variable} represents
a group of program, or user, variables that have similar alias
characteristics.  We originally used {@link
scale.alias.steensgaard.Steensgaard Steensgaard's} alias analysis
algorithm to create these groups which we also call abstract locations
(abstract location and virtual variable can be used interchangeably).
For example, in the sequence, <code>p = &amp;a; p = &amp;b</code>, a
virtual variable is created to represent <code>a</code>,
<code>b</code>, and <code>*p</code>.  This means that, conservatively,
any use of <code>*p</code> may use <code>a</code> or <code>b</code>.
A very conservative approach may create one virtual variable for every
user variable.

<p>

Our basic algorithm works as follows:
<ol>
<li>Perform alias analysis to identify the virtual variables
<li>Perform a pass over the program and insert Chi and Mu nodes for
the virtual variables.
<li>Convert to SSA with the virtual variables
</ol>

In step 2, we insert a Mu node for each use of an aliased user
variable.  We insert a Chi node for each definition of an aliased user
variable.  We also insert a Chi at function calls for each actual
aliased actual parameter.  Using our small example from above, if we
create a virtual variable, <code>_v</code>, to represent
<code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>*p</code> then we add a
<code>Mu(_v)/Chi(_v)</code> to each use/definition of <code>a</code>,
<code>b</code>, or <code>*p</code>.  Note - the <code>Chi(_v)</code>
is actually an assignment of the form <code>_v = Chi(_v)</code>.

<p>

When the CFG is converted into SSA form, the virtual variables as as
well as the user variables are renamed.  This means that {@link
scale.score.expr.PhiExpr Phi nodes} are created for the virtual
variables and the virtual variables obey the single assignment rule of
SSA form.

<p>

The scheme as described above works because each indirect variable
(e.g., <code>*p</code>) represents at most one virtual variable (i.e.,
<code>p</code> points to at most one abstract location).
Unfortunately, the scheme does not work when <code>p</code> may point
to multiple locations.  In the Shapiro/Horwitz algorithm,
<code>p</code> may point to multiple locations.  We need to extend our
alias SSA representation to handle the Shapiro analysis.

<p>

Again, using the example from above, let's say the Shapiro algorithm
partitions the user variables such that <code>p-&gt;{a}</code> or
<code>p-&gt;{b}</code> (i.e., <code>p</code> points to <code>a</code> or
to <code>b</code>, but <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are not
aliases).  This is different from the Steensgaard algorithm in which
<code>p-&gt;{a, b}</code> (i.e., <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are
aliases).  To incorporate the Shapiro results into SSA form, we need a
different scheme to represent the MayUse and MayDefs.  For example, a
use/def of <code>a</code> is not a use/def of <code>b</code>, but a
use/def of <code>*p</code> may be a use/def of <code>a</code> or
<code>b</code>.

<p>

We extend the basic scheme for including alias information by changing
the meaning of a virtual variable.  In our new scheme, a virtual
variable represents multiple locations and we attach information to
the variable to distinguish between the locations.  We assign a
superset and subset name to the virtual variable.  Essentially, the
superset name represents indirect variables (e.g., <code>*p</code>), and the subset
name represents user variables.  In our example, we can represent the
relations among the variables using set notation, where a virtual
variable represents the set <code>{*p, {a}, {b}}</code>.
This means, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> belong to distinct
subsets but they are members of the same enclosing set which includes
<code>*p</code>.

<p>

In theory, our extended algorithm for adding alias information to SSA
isn't much different that the original.
<ol>
<li>Perform alias analysis to identify the virtual variables
<li>Perform a pass over the program and insert Chi and Mu nodes for
the virtual variables.
<li>Convert to SSA with the virtual variables
</ol>

In Step 1, we create virtual variables using the new name scheme.  The
number of subset names depends upon the number of categories used in
the Shapiro pointer analysis.  In Step 2, inserting the Chi and Mu
nodes is slightly different.  We insert a Chi/Mu for a superset
virtual variable for a definition/use of an indirect variable.  We
insert a Chi/Mu for a subset virtual variable for a definition/use of
a user variable.  In Step 3, we also convert a CFG to SSA, but we
ignore the subset names for the purposes of creating the the
MayDef/Use links.  The subset names must be preserved for the
optimizations to make use of the more precise alias information.

<p>

Note that the MayDef/Use links (and SSA numbers) ignore the subset
name.  But, the optimizations must check for the subset names when
propagating information.  Analysis information should only be
propagated when the virtual variables are equivalent.  Two virtual
variables are equivalent under the following conditions: 1) The subset
and superset names are the same, 2) One virtual variable only contains
a superset name and both the superset names are the same.

<p>

The superset and subset distinctions are intended to help the
optimization phases.  We only want to propagate information for
equivalent virtual variables.  That is, when propagation information
associated with subset name, we ignore different subset names but we
must perform an appropriate action for a virtual variable with the
same subset name or superset name.  This is the main difference
between the old scheme and the new scheme. In the old scheme, analysis
information is always propagated down may def/use links.  But, in the
new scheme, we selectively propagate analysis information down the may
def/use links.

<p>

Using our example, we create 3 virtual variables, <code>_v#p</code>,
<code>_v#p.a</code>, and <code>_v#p.b</code> (our implementation
actually uses numbers, so it's _v#0.0, <code>_v#0.1</code> and
<code>_v#0.2</code>, but we use the letters to hopefully make things
clearer.  The description of {@link scale.score.trans.CP constant
propagation (CP)} below is not meant to match the algorithm in Scale.
Instead, we just attempt to illustrate how an optimization phase
should use our SSA extensions.

<p>

We use the following program to illustrate the extensions (given that
<code>p-&gt;{a}</code>, or <code>p-&gt;{b}</code>.
<pre>
  a = 1;
  b = 2;
    = *p;
    = b;
    = a;
</pre>
Using Steensgaard analysis (or Shapiro's analysis with 1 category), we
cannot propagate 1 to the use of <code>a</code> or 2 to the use of <code>b</code>.  But,
with Shapiro's analysis with multiple categories we can.  We
annotate the program with the Chi and Mu information after converting
to SSA form
<pre>
  a = 1;  _v#p.a_1 = Chi(_v#p.a)
  b = 2;  _v#p.b_2 = Chi(_v#p.b_1)
    = *p; Mu(_v#p_2)
    = b;  Mu(_v#p.b_2)
    = a;  Mu(_v#p.a_2)
</pre>

In the example, CP associates 1 with <code>_v#p.a_1</code> and
<code>_v#p.b_1</code> after statement 1. The may def-use link for
<code>_v#p.a_1</code> points to the use of <code>_v#p.b_1</code> at
statement 2.  Since the virtual variable at statement 2 is not
equivalent to the virtual variable at statement 1, CP does not
propagate the value 1 to <code>_v#p.b_1</code>.  Instead, CP
associates 2 with <code>_v#p.b_2</code> and <code>_v#p_2</code>.
Then, CP follows the may def-use links to the Mu nodes at statements
3, 4, 5.  At statement 3, <code>_v#p_2</code> is 2 so the use of
<code>*p</code> can be replaced by 2.  The same action occurs at
statement 4 for <code>b</code>. At statement 4, <code>a</code> can be
replaced by 1.

<p>

If there is control flow in the program:
<pre>
  if ()
    a = 1; _v#p.a_1 = Chi(_v#p.a)
  else
    b = 2; _v#p.b_2 = Chi(_v#p.b_1)
	 _v#p_3 = Phi(_v#p_1,_v#p_2)
   = *p;   Mu(_v#p_3)
   = b;    Mu(_v#p.b_3)
   = a;    Mu(_v#p.a_3)
</pre>

In this case, CP associates <i>not a constant</i> with
<code>_v#p_3</code>, <code>_v#p.a_3</code>, and <code>_v#p.b_3</code>
at the Phi node.  Then, none of the uses can be replaced by a
constant.

<p>

Note - in the presence of control flow, we only need to add Phi
functions for superset names because the definition of a superset is
equivalent to definitions for each of the subsets.
