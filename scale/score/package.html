This package implements an internal representation of source programs
using a control flow graph (CFG) called {@link scale.score.Scribble
Scribble}.  The CFG is implemented using {@link
scale.score.chords.Chord Chord} instances as the nodes of the graph.
{@link scale.score.expr.Expr Expressions} are attached to the CFG
nodes.  Other representations are available but all optimizations are
performed on the CFG while it is in {@link scale.score.SSA SSA} form.
The {@link scale.score.Scribble Scribble} class is the container class
for the CFG.

<p>

The {@link scale.score.chords scale.score.chords} package is used to
represent nodes in the CFG.  The {@link scale.score.expr
scale.score.expr} package is used to represent expression trees.  Each
{@link scale.score.chords.ExprChord ExprChord} instance has a single
expression tree attached.  The easiest way to understand this is to
display the CFG for VERY simple programs using the -sga and -sgb
switches on the command line.  For example,

<pre>
  java scale.test.Scale test.c -sga s -sgb s -O s
</pre>
will display the CFG for test.c both before and after entering SSA form.
Make sure that the daVinci executable is accessible on your path.

The documentation for the {@link scale.score.chords.LoopHeaderChord LoopHeaderChord}
class illustrates a CFG.

<h2>Control Flow Graph (CFG)</h2>

Scale uses an internal control flow graph to represent programs.  All
optimizations are performed on this representation.  The graph may be
in <i>static single assignment</i> ({@link scale.score.SSA SSA}) form.
Currently, all major optimizations in Scale are performed when the CFG
is in SSA form.  While it is possible to go in and out of SSA form,
our current optimizations leave the CFG in a valid SSA form making
this un-necessary.

<p>

Nodes in the CFG are one of two flavors.  Executable statements are
represent by an instance of the {@link scale.score.chords.Chord Chord}
class.  Expressions are represented by an instance of the {@link
scale.score.expr.Expr Expr} class.

<p>

<h3>{@link scale.score.chords Statements (Chords)}</h3>

Instances of the {@link scale.score.chords.Chord Chord} class form the
nodes of the CFG that are linked together to form the graph.  An
instance of a {@link scale.score.chords.SequentialChord
SequentialChord} has only one successor while a DecisionChord instance
has two or more successors.  Any node may have one or more
predecessors.  Classes derived from these two classes are used to
represent various executable statements.  A simplified class hierarchy
is:

<pre>
Chord <- SequentialChord <- ExprChord <- PhiExprNode
                         <- LoopPreHeaderChord
                         <- LoopHeaderChord <- BeginChord
                         <- LoopExitChord
                         <- LoopTailChord
                         <- BranchChord <- GotoChord
                         <- EndChord <- LeaveChord <- ReturnChord
      <- DecisionChord <- IfThenEsleChord
                       <- SwitchChord
</pre>

Irreducible graphs are converted to reducible graphs by
node-splitting.  All implicit and explicit loops in the original
program are converted to the same form.  For example, the C for
statement
<pre>
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) body;
</pre>
the graph looks like:
<pre>
         ExprChord (i = 0)
              |
              v
         LoopPreHeader
              |
              v
    ---->LoopHeader
    ^         |
    |         v
    |    IfThenElseChord (i < n) -> LoopExitChord ->
    |         | T
    |         v
    |       body
    |         |
    |         v
    |    ExprNode (i++)
    |         |
    |         v
     <---LoopTailChord
</pre>

The regularity of this form makes analysis of the graph easier to
accomplish; there are only two predecessors to the LoopHeader, all
loop exits are marked, and the LoopPreHeader and LoopHeader provide
markers for the places that the SSA required Phi nodes may be
inserted.

<p>

If the loop is placed in the <i>loop test at end</i> form, the graph looks like:

<pre>
         ExprChord (i = 0)
              |
              v
         IfThenElseChord (i >= n) ------------------>
              |                                      |
              v                                      |
         LoopPreHeader                               |
              |                                      |
              v                                      |
    ---->LoopHeader                                  |
    ^         |                                      |
    |         v                                      |
    |       body                                     |
    |         |                                      |
    |         V                                      |
    |    ExprNode (i++)                              |
    |         |                                      |
    |         v                                      v
    |    IfThenElseChord (i < n) -> LoopExitChord ->
    |         | T
    |         v
     <---LoopTailChord
</pre>

Basic blocks are not represented explicitly.  Rather, a simple
detection scheme is used to detect the beginning and and of a basic
block:
<ul>
<li>A basic block begins at the node with more than one predecessor or whose predecessor has more than one successor.
<li>A basic block ends at the node with more than one successor or whose successor has more than one predecessor.
</ul>

The disadvantage to this scheme is that there are many more nodes in
the CFG than would be the case if only explicit basic blocks were
nodes.  As an example, when processing Phi nodes of a basic block, all
CFG nodes in the basic block must be scanned.  That is why Scale uses
an explicit class ({@link scale.score.chords.PhiExprChord
PhiExprChord}) for these nodes even though they are identical to any
other {@link scale.score.chords.ExprChord ExprChord}.  The advantage
to this representation is that manipulations of the graph are straight
forward.

<p>

It is possible to travel easily in any direction in the graph.
However, most current processing in Scale spans the graph in the same
way; the backward link is used primarily for inserting and deleting nodes.

<p>

Each node has an integer <i>color</i>.  To scan every node in the graph,
first the base color is incremented by one.  Starting at the root node
in the graph, all successors whose color is different from the base
color are placed on a stack and their color is changed to the base
color.  As each node is popped off of the stack, its successors are
processed similarly.

<h3>{@link scale.score.expr Expressions}</h3>
<p>

Expressions are represented as a tree.  Each node of the tree is
unique -- it does not appear in any other tree.  Chords may be linked
to none, one, or more expressions depending on the Chord class.  An
{@link scale.score.chords.ExprChord ExprChord} instance has one or two
expression trees while a {@link scale.score.chords.LoopHeaderChord
LoopHeaderChord} instance has none.

<p>

The simplified expression class hierarchy is:
<pre>
  Expr <- UnaryExpr <- AbsoluteExpr
                    <- BitComplementExpr
                    <- ConversionExpr
                    <- NotExpr
                    <- NegativeExpr
                    <- LoadValueIndirectExpr
                    <- FieldExpr <- LoadFieldAddressExpr
                                 <- LoadFieldValueExpr
       <- BinaryExpr <- AdditionExpr
                     <- SubstractionExpr
                     <- MultiplicationExpr
                     <- DivisionExpr
                     <- EqualityExpr
                     <- LessExpr
                     <- LessEqualExpr
                     <- MaxExpr
                     <- AndExpr
                     <- OrExpr
                     <- BitAndExpr
                     <- BitOrExpr
       <- NaryExpr <- CallExpr
                   <- VectorExpr <- PhiExpr
       <- LoadExpr <- LoadDeclValueExpr
                   <- LoadDeclAddressExpr
       <- DualExpr
       <- SubscriptExpr
       <- ValueExpr <- LiteralExpr
                    <- NilExpr
</pre>

Each expression has a type and none, one, or more successor expressions.
Other information may be associated with each expression.

<p>

When in {@link scale.score.SSA SSA} form, each {@link
scale.score.expr.LoadExpr LoadExpr} instance has a link to the {@link
scale.score.chords.ExprChord ExprChord} instance that defines that
version of the variable.  Likewise, the ExprChord instance has a list
of the LoadExpr instances that use the value defined.  The SSA
variables are actually different variables represented by a different
instance of the {@link scale.clef.decl.VariableDecl VariableDecl}
class.  Each such instance has a link to the original VariableDecl
instance.

<p>

The {@link scale.score.expr.DualExpr DualExpr} class is used to represent expressions that have both a
high-level form and a low-level form.  For example, subscript
operations have a high-level form such as <code>a[i]</code> and a low-level
form that uses address operations such as <code>address_of(a) + i *
sizeof(int)</code>.  The high-level form is used in analysis such as
dependence testing and the low level form is used for code generation.
Each high-level expression provides a method that converts it to its
low-level form.

<p>

The {@link scale.score.analyses.MayDef MayDef} and {@link
scale.score.analyses.MayUse MayUse} are used to represent the
information obtained from alias analysis.

<p>

The expression trees for <code>c = a++</code> look like:

<pre>
  ExprChord <- LoadDeclAddressExpr (temp)
     |      <- LoadDeclValueExpr (a)
     v
  ExprChord <- LoadDeclAddressExpr (a)
     |      <- AdditionExpr <- LoadDeclValueExpr (temp)
     |                      <- LiteralExpr (1)
     v
  ExprChord <- LoadDeclAddressExpr (c)
            <- LoadDeclValueExpr (temp)
</pre>

In {@link scale.score.SSA SSA} form there would be a link from the
first {@link scale.score.chords.ExprChord ExprChord} instance to the two
LoadDeclValue instances for \verb*temp*.

<h3>{@link scale.score.trans Optimizations}</h3>

The current version of Scale performs only one loop optimization (loop permutation).
Several scalar optimizations are performed:

<ul>
<li>{@link scale.score.trans.SCC Sparse Conditional Constant Propagation}
<li>{@link scale.score.trans.PRE Partial Redundancy Elimination}
<li>{@link scale.score.trans.CP Copy Propagation}
<li>{@link scale.score.trans.ValNum Value Numbering}
<li>{@link scale.score.trans.LICM Loop Invariant Code Motion}
<li>{@link scale.score.trans.UselessCopy Useless Copy Elimination}
<li>{@link scale.score.trans.DeadVarElimination Dead Variable Elimination}
</ul>

All but the last two require the CFG to be in SSA form and alias
analysis to have been performed.  

<p>

Several optimizations require {@link scale.score.Domination dominance information}.  Scale provides
methods for computing both the pre- and post-dominance information,
the {@link scale.score.DominanceFrontier dominance frontier}, and the iterated dominance frontier.  If the
optimization adds or deletes CFG nodes, this information will be
re-computed on demand for the next optimization.

<p>

Scale provides {@link scale.score.pred.References reference
information} for variables that lists each CFG node and expression
node that references a particular variable.  This information is
updated as an optimization adds or deletes references.

<p>

While not currently used, Scale provides a method to obtain the {@link
scale.score.CDG control dependence graph}.  This information was
needed for research into branch prediction.

<p>

Each optimization can be selection by a command line switch.
The order that the optimizations is not constrained.

<p>

The coalescing of SSA variable names when leaving {@link
scale.score.SSA SSA} form is not strictly required.  It is also the
most expensive process because it does a live analysis of each SSA
variable.  We leave it in because it makes debugging the generated C
or assembly code easier; the variable reference correspond more
closely to the original program.

<p>

Our experiments have indicated that partial-redundancy elimination has
very little effect on the 51 benchmarks in our regression tests.  And,
copy propagation is not required unless partial-redundancy elimination
is performed.

<h3>{@link scale.score.analyses Alias Analyses}</h3>

Scale provides seven ways of performing alias analysis:
<ol>
<li>None - no SSA-based optimizations can be performed.
<li>Simple - All variables whose address is taken are placed in the same alias category.
<li>Steensgaard based on [].
<li>Shapiro-Horowitz based on []. 1, 2, 4, or 8 categories are allowed.
<li>Inter-procedural Simple
<li>Inter-procedural Steensgaard.
<li>Inter-procedural Shapiro-Horowitz.
</ol>

For the inter-procedural analysis all modules of a program must be
compiled together.  Every routine in the program is converted to its
CFG form before analysis is performed.  This results in very large
compile-time memory requirements.  Because of the memory requirements
and because we currently have no optimizations that use the
inter-procedural information, most compiles are performed using either
method 1.  

<p>

Experiments we have run to-date do not show any significant
improvement of Steensgaard or Shapiro-Horowitz over the simple
analysis on our set of 51 benchmarks.

<h2>Profiling</h2>
<p>
The user's program is first modified to produce the profiling
information by inserting operations into the CFG.  This insertion
occurs just prior to code generation.  The user requests this via
a command line switch.
<p>
When the program is executed it produces a <code>.pft</code> file
for every source module in the program.  This file contains the
profile information on the number of times a block, edge, or path
in the program was executed.
<p>
On a subsequent compilation an optimization can request that this
profile information be read and the CFG annotated with it.  For
edge profiling, the out-going CFG edges of a <code>
scale.score.chords.DecisionChord</code> are given a
probability of that edge being used.
<p>
<b>In order for this to work</b>, the CFG must be equivalent, in
the structure of the graph edges when the profile information is
read, to the CCFG when the profiling operations were inserted.
<p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>
<b>
I am a bit lost in understanding the structure of the Scale CFG. So, I
have a few questions. Instances of the Chord class appear to represent
a number of things. Is this correct? Or, are all Chord instances basic
blocks?
</b>
<blockquote>
Chord instances are nodes in the CFG.  Scale does not explicitly
represent basic blocks.  Most Chord instances represent simple
imperative operations and are of the form
<pre>
   a <- b + c
</pre>
<p>
There are methods that let you determine if a CFG node begins or ends
a basic block.  The simple definition of a basic block in Scale is
<ul>
<li> a basic block begins with the node that has more than one in-coming
  CFG edge or whose predecessor has more than one out-going CFG edge, and

<li> a basic block ends with a CFG node that has more than one out-going 
  CFG edge or whose successor has more than one in-coming CFG edge.
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>
Is there code in Scale that would help me detect basic blocks?
</b>
<blockquote>
Yes - 
<dl>
<dt>{@link scale.score.chords#firstInBasicBlock firstInBasicBlock()}<dd> returns the first CFG node (Chord)
   in the basic block containing chord

<dt>{@link scale.score.chords#lastInBasicBlock lastInBasicBlock()}<dd> returns true if this CFG node is the last
   node in a basic block.
</dl>
{@link scale.score.trans.SCC SCC} has examples of their use.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>
What does a loop look like?
</b>
<blockquote>
The Loop class represents information about a loop.  It is not the loop.
The loop is in the CFG and has this basic form:
<pre>
             |
             v
           LoopPreHeaderChord
             |
             v
   ------> LoopHeaderChord
   |         |
   |         v
   |       IfThenElseChord -------> LoopExitChord
   |         |
   |         v
   |        ....
   |         |
   |         v
   |<----  LoopTailChord
</pre>
The loop exit test position may vary depending on whether it is in SSA
form, what the source program form was, was <tt>l</tt> specified using the <tt>-O</tt> switch
selected, etc.  And, there may be more than one
{@link scale.score.chords.LoopExitChord LoopExitChord}.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>
Is the loop test always done at the top of the loop?
</b>
<blockquote>
No - using <tt>l</tt> with the <tt>-O</tt> switch causes the loop test to be placed at the
end of a loop and do-while loops naturally have the test at the end.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>
Is there a document with a graphical depiction of a CFG? I would like
to be able to see what a loop looks like.
</b>
<blockquote>
You can get a good idea by using DaVinci and the <tt>-sga</tt> or
<tt>-sgb</tt> switches for the {@link scale.test.Scale Scale} class.
Display only <em>very simple</em> programs or the display will be
too complex.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>
Is there any documentation or examples that I could look at showing
how to insert new sections of code and maintain the integrity of
the CFG?
</b>
<blockquote>
Unfortunately there is no such document.  And, it is very important to
keep the CFG information valid.  There are three things that must be
kept correct:

<ol>
<li> The use-def links.  This is the hardest and most important.  PRE
      and ScalarReplacement do not do this fully as they both may
      generate multiple defs of the same variable.  The other opts
      maintain the use-def links correctly.

      At some future time, we plan to make it easy to redo SSA
      for selected variables.  Now, you may have to exit SSA form and
      re-enter it to make the use-def info correct.

<li> The variable reference information.  One can simply call
         {@link scale.score.Scribble#recomputeRefs recomputeRefs()} at the end of the
         optimization or one can update the information on the fly
         using
<pre>
         refs.removeRefs(Chord s);
         s.recordRefs(References refs);
</pre>

<li>  The dominance information.  If an optimization adds or deletes a 
      CFG node, it should call <tt>scribble.recomputeDominators()</tt>
      before it terminates.
</ol>

All of the optimizations in scale.score.trans show examples of keeping
the CFG up to date.  <tt>SCC</tt>, <tt>ValNum</tt>, <tt>PRE</tt>,
<tt>LICM</tt> all insert new CFG nodes.  It is very important to
insert a <tt>NullChord</tt> before a CFG node that is deleted if the
deleted CFG node has multiple in-coming CFG edges.  This is due to a
design flaw and is necessary to keep the Phi node information valid.
The <tt>NullChord</tt>s are deleted later.  An example of this exists
in <tt>SCC</tt>.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>
Can I exit SSA form and re-enter as another way of keeping the CFG valid?
</b>
<blockquote>
Yes, this is a valid approach.
<p>
One area where you will have a problem is in the alias analysis.
Alias variables must exist for all variables before entering SSA form.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>
Does the method <tt>ssa.removePhis()</tt> exit SSA? Would I then call
<tt>ssa.buildSSA()</tt> again to recompute SSA form?
</b>
<blockquote>
Yes.  You would also have to decide if you should do
<tt>ssa.coalesceVariables()</tt> to eliminate most SSA renamed
variables.  It would definitely be faster not to call this method and
it is probably not necessary.  However, if you do not call it after
<tt>ssa.removePhis()</tt>, the names can never be coalesced.  This may
have an adverse effect on the backend generated code as there will be
many more temporary variables.  This may increase the register
pressure and will definitely cause the register allocation to be
slower.
