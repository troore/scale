<title>CFG Optimizations</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">

This package provides various optimizations that operate on the {@link
scale.score.Scribble CFG}.

<h2><a name="legal">Does the Optimization Improve the Program</a></h2>
<p>
When an optimization considers performing some transformation,
there are two questions that must be answered:
<ol>
<li> Can the transformation be performed?  That is, if the
transformation is made will the transformed program be correct.  In
this context a correct program is one that performs as it is coded.
<li> Should the transformation be performed?  This is a harder
question to answer because the answer depends on how well the
transformed program performs.  Does it execute faster?  Does it
require less space?
</ol>
We will call question one the <b style="color:red">legal</b>
question and question two the <b style="color:red">beneficial</b>
question.
<p>
Because the interactions between optimizations can be very complex,
some transformations may not appear to be benneficial but may
enable an optimization that is very beneficial.  One transformation
may also inhibit a more beneficial transformation.
<p>
Most transformations result in an increase in register pressure.
If the register pressure, for some sequence of generated
instructions, becomes too great, register spilling results.
Spilling a register may negate any benefit the transformation may
otherwise have provided.  If the register pressure becomes large
enough, the transformed program may perform worse than the
un-optimized program.
<p>
Answering question 2 optimally in any particular context is very
difficult.  Heuristics are usually used.  Many of the Scale
optimizations are written to assume that the answer to question two
is always the same as the answer to question one; if it can be
done, it will be done.
<p>

<h2>How to Add a New CFG Optimization</h2>

To add a new optimization to be performed on the CFG representation of
a user function do:

<ol>

<li>Create the Java class and place it in the
<code>scale/score/trans</code> directory.  This class must be derived
from the {@link scale.score.trans.Optimization Optimization} class.
Note that the {@link scale.score.trans.Inlining Inlining} optimization
is a special case because it is performed over all functions at the
same time.  Therefore, it is not derived from the {@link
scale.score.trans.Optimization Optimization} class.

<li>Make sure that your optimization defines the {@link
scale.score.trans.Optimization#requiresSSA requiresSSA()} method
correctly.  This method informs the compiler of the required condition
for the CFG in order for your optimization to be performed.

<li>Make sure your optimization either leaves the CFG in the same
state it obtained or executes the {@link
scale.score.Scribble#invalidSSAForm invalidSSAForm()} method.

<li>Modify the {@link scale.test.Scale Scale} class to add the
information needed to find and invoke your optimization.

<ol>
<li>Choose a <i>unique</i> alphabetic letter to represent your optimization.
<li>Add that letter to the <code>optimizationLetter</code> field.

<li>Add the name of your optimization to the
<code>optimizationName</code> field in the same position as you added
your letter in the previous step.

<li>Add the name of your optimization class to the
<code>optimizationClass</code> field in the same order.

<li>Decide if and in what order your letter should be added to the
<code>cannedOpts</code> field.  The elements of this array correspond
to the five optimization levels (i.e., <code>-O0, -O1, -O2, -O3, -O4</code>).

</ol>
</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<h3>SSA Form and Optimizations</h3>

Most optimizations are performed on the CFG when it is in {@link
scale.score.SSA SSA} form.  SSA form provides variable liveness
information that is not available otherwise.  However, some
optimizations (e.g., {@link scale.score.trans.GlobalVarReplacement
GlobalVarReplacement}, {@link scale.score.trans.SFIR SFIR}) require
non-SSA form because they are not able to easily keep the SSA form
valid.  Some optimizations don't care either way (e.g., {@link
scale.score.trans.TreeHeight TreeHeight}, {@link
scale.score.trans.BasicBlockOps BasicBlockOps}).

<p>
The SSA form of the CFG is valid if two conditions are met:

<ol>

<li>There is one and only one <i>def</i> of a variable that is in SSA form.
({@link scale.score.trans.URJ URJ} sometimes violates this rule.

<li>The lexicographical order of the <i>defs</i> of the renamed SSA
variables is maintained.  ({@link scale.score.trans.PRE PRE} violates
this rule.)

</ol>

The compiler is designed to allow the user of the compiler to be able
to specify the order in which the optimizations are performed.  For
this reason, each optimization is required to specify in what form it
requires the CFG to be in and what form it leaves the CFG in.
<p>
The {@link scale.score.trans.Optimization#requiresSSA requiresSSA()}
specifies in what form the CFG is required.

<dl>
<dt>NO_SSA<dd>The optimization requires that the CFG not be in SSA form.
<dt>IN_SSA<dd>The optimization requires that the CFG be in SSA form.
<dt>VALID_SSA<dd>The optimization requires that the CFG be in valid SSA form.
<dt>NA_SSA<dd>The optimization does not require SSA form or non-SSA form.
</dl>

The compiler assumes that an optimization leaves the CFG in the same
SSA state as it received it originally.  However, an optimization can
specify that it made the SSA form invalid (violated one or both of the
two requirements listed above) by calling the {@link
scale.score.Scribble#invalidSSAForm invalidSSAForm()} method.

<h3>Spanning the CFG</h3>

Most optimizations have to visit every CFG node.  Scale provides
several ways of spanning the CFG and there are examples in every
optimization.

The easiest method is to use a <i>visit</i> pattern.
For example,

<pre>
(1)    Stack wl = WorkArea.getStack("xxx");
(2)    Chord.nextVisit();
(3)    wl.push(begin);
(4)    begin.setVisited();

(5)    while (!wl.isEmpty()) { 
(6)      Chord c = (Chord) wl.pop(); 
(7)      c.pushOutCfgEdges(wl);
(8)      ...
       }

(9)    WorkArea.returnStack(wl);
</pre>

<ol>

<li>Obtain a {@link scale.common.Stack Stack} to be used as a work
list.  We use our own version of the stack implementation to avoid the
overhead of <i>synchronization</i>.  We use the {@link
scale.common.WorkArea WorkArea} class to obtain previously used stacks
in order to avoid allocating new stacks and to avoid the allocations
required to grow the stack.  A unique identification is supplied so
that if the code fails to return the stack (see (9)), it is possible
to determine what place in the compiler obtained it.

<li>Since the CFG is a cyclic graph, the spanning algorithm must know
if a node has been visited.  This statement assigns a unique integer
value to the spanning.  If a node has been <i>colored</i> with this
value, it has been visited.

<li>Start with the first node of the CFG.  All CFG have one node that
has no predecessors.  The {@link scale.score.Scribble#getBegin
getBegin()} method can be used to obtain this CFG node.

<li>Mark this node as visited.  A node is marked as visited as it is
placed on the work list.

<li>If the work list is empty, the CFG has been spanned.

<li>Remove a node from the work list.

<li>Place all of this node's successors <i>that have not been
visited</i> on the worklist. See {@link
scale.score.chords.Chord#pushOutCfgEdges pushOutCfgEdges()}.

<li>Do the processing required for this node.

<li>Return the stack so it can be used again.

</ol>

It is possible to span the CFG in other orders and there are examples
of this through out the compiler.  An example is that no CFG node be
processed before all of it's immediate predecessors have been
processed. See {@link scale.score.chords.Chord#pushChordWhenReady
pushChordWhenReady()}.
<p>

An important thing to remember about the above code example is that
there is only one <i>color</i> that can be assigned to a CFG node.
Thus, if the processing in step 8 must also span the CFG, the two
spanning algorithms will collide.  To overcome this problem, a
different spanning algorithm can be used for one of them.

<pre>
    Stack   wl   = WorkArea.getStack("xxx");
    HashSet done = WorkArea.getSet("xxx");

    wl.push(begin);
    while (!wl.empty()) {
      Chord c = (Chord) wl.pop();
      c.pushOutCfgEdges(wl, done);
      ...
    }

    WorkArea.returnStack(wl);
    WorkArea.returnSet(done);
</pre>

In this example a set of visited nodes is used in place of
</i>coloring</i> each node.

<h3>Dominators</h3>

Various optimizations require information on {@link
scale.score.Domination dominators}.  The compiler computes this
information the first time it is requested. (See {@link
scale.score.Scribble#getDomination getDomination()}.)  If an
optimization changes the CFG by adding or deleting a CFG node, then
the optimization must either:

<ul>

<li>Update the dominator information using {@link
scale.score.Domination#addDominatee addDominatee()}, or

<li>Tell the compiler that the domination information is no longer
valid by calling {@link scale.score.Scribble#recomputeDominators
recomputeDominators()}.

</ul>

<h3>Dominance Frontier</h3>

Various optimizations require information on the {@link
scale.score.DominanceFrontier dominance frontier} of a node.  The
compiler computes this information the first time it is
requested. (See {@link scale.score.Scribble#getDominanceFrontier
getDominanceFrontier()}.)  If an optimization changes the CFG by
changing the dominance frontier of a CFG node, then the optimization
must tell the compiler that the dominance frontier information is no
longer valid by calling {@link scale.score.Scribble#recomputeDominators
recomputeDominators()}.

<h3>References</h3>

Various optimizations require knowing where in the CFG each variable
is referenced.  The compiler computes this information the first time
it is requested. (See {@link scale.score.Scribble#getRefs getRefs()}.)
The {@link scale.score.pred.References References} class provides
various methods for accessing and updating this information.  An
optimization can force the compiler to recompute this information as
well by calling the {@link scale.score.Scribble#recomputeRefs
recomputeRefs()} method.

<h3>Loops</h3>

The compiler maintains a significant amount of information concerning
each {@link scale.score.chords.LoopHeaderChord loop} in the CFG.  The
compiler computes this information the first time it is requested. An
optimization that changes the loop structure of the CFG (e.g., loop
fusion, loop permutation} must inform the compiler that this
information is no longer valid by calling the {@link
scale.score.Scribble#recomputeLoops recomputeLoops()} method.

<h3>Partial Redundancy Elimination (PRE)</h3>

{@link scale.score.trans.PRE PRE} doesn't do much.  And, it's
expensive.  It requires an additional constraint on the {@link
scale.score.SSA SSA} form that is only valid prior to the operation of
any other optimization.  For that reason, Scale leaves SSA form and
re-enters it if PRE is used after some other optimization.  PRE is not
under regression test.

<p>
{@link scale.score.trans.ValNum Global value numbering} is much more effective.
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>
<b>
Some optimizations don't seem to be effective on Fortran code.
</b>
<blockquote>
The problem may be due to the fact that Fortran passes arguments by
reference.  If an index variable is passed to a subroutine, it causes
some optimizations to skip that variable.  Also, if the <code>DO</code> loop is
controlled by variables passed in as an arguments, Scale may fail
to find important loop information.
