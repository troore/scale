Scale is an easily modified compiler written in Java.  A more complete
description is available at the University of Massachusetts <a
href="http://www-ali.cs.umass.edu/Scale" TARGET="TOP">Scale web
site</a>.  The top-level class is the {@link scale.test.Scale Scale}
class which provides the top-level control.

<p>
Scale is composed of several parts roughly corresponding to the following steps:
<ol>
<li><a href="#edg">Parsing</a>
<li><a href="#cfg">Conversion to the Control Flow Graph</a>
<li>{@link scale.alias Alias Analysis} Alias Analysis
<li>{@link scale.score.SSA Conversion to Static Single Assignment Form}
<li><a href="#optimizations">Optimizing the CFG</a>
<li><a href="#backend">Code Generation</a>
</ol>
These steps are controlled by the {@link scale.test.Scale Scale} class.

<h2><a name="edg">Parsing</a></h2>

Scale uses parsers written in Java to parse C and Fortran programs.
These parsers create an <i>abstract syntax tree</i> (AST)
representation of the source module which we called Clef.  The AST is
a high level representation with very little lowering of the original
program structures.

<p>

<h3><a name="clef2c">Clef AST To C</a></h3>
A Scale Clef AST may be converted into a C program using {@link scale.clef.Clef2C Clef2C}.
This is used primarily for debugging the Scale compiler.
<p>

<h2><a name="cfg">Conversion to the Control Flow Graph</a></h2>
After a Clef AST has been constructed and analysed, a {@link scale.score Scribble} CFG is constructed for each routine in the program.
Part of this conversion includes:
<ul>
<li>dead code elimination
<li>lowering of high level structures such as subscript expressions
<li>converting implicit loops to explicit loops
<li>converting irreducible graphs to reducible graphs
</ul>
<p>

<h3><a name="scribble2c">Scribble CFG To C</a></h3>
Scale can transform the Scribble CFG into a C program using {@link scale.score.Scribble2C Scribble2C}.
This transformation is used for testing the compiler.
It provides a way of validating the compiler and has been used to instrument programs.
<p>

<h2><a name="optimizations">Optimizing the CFG</a></h2>
Scale performs the following {@link scale.score.trans optimizations} optimizations on the SSA form of the Scribble CFG:
<ul>
<li>Sparse Conditional Constant Propagation
<li>Partial Redundancy Elimination
<li>Copy Propagation
<li>Value Numbering
<li>Loop Invariant Code Motion
<li>Inlining
<li>Loop Un-rolling
</ul>
<p>

<h2><a name="backend">Code Generation</a></h2>
<p>
Scale can transform the Scribble CFG into a machine instructions for the Alpha and Sparc&reg; V8 microprocessor chip.
A {@link scale.backend backend} backend for Mips chips is being developed.  Backends for additional microprocessors can be added without modifying the Scale compiler.
<p>
The backend is composed of machine dependent and machine independent parts.
It uses object-oriented concepts to separate the parts.
For example, the register allocator is machine independent.  It can be easily replaced
by a different register allocator and utilized by all the machine code generators.
To do this, the concept of an instruction is machine independent and has a specified set of attributes.
Machine specific instructions are then derived from this basic concept.
