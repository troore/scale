<title>Steensgaard Alias Analysis</title>

<body bgcolor="white">
Provides alias analysis using {@link scale.alias.steensgaard.Steensgaard Steensgaard}'s algorithm.
<p>
Basically, Steensgaard's analysis context-insensitive (meaning it
doesn't care about function call paths and scoping) and
flow-insensitive (meaning it doesn't care about statement ordering).
This means that the analysis produces a (sometimes very) conservative
result.  The analysis doesn't operate on names - instead we assign
<i>types</i> to names and operate on the types.  At the beginning of the
analysis there is a one-to-one correspondence between names and types.
The algorithm merges the types during the analysis and at the end, a
single type may represent many names.  The type is a representation of
the alias characteristics of the program. The use of types in the
algorithm is a little confusing because they are not based upon real
programming language types.  The reason is that the algorithm is based
upon type inference algorithms.

<p>

For example, if we have the following program:
<pre>
int *g;
void foo() {
 int b;
 g = &b;
 ...
}
void bar() {
 int a;
 g = &a;
 ...
}
</pre>

Then, after the analysis, it appears that <code>g -&gt; {a,b}</code>
(<code>g</code> points to <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>), meaning
that <code>*g</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> are aliases of
each other.  Of course, if we look at the program, <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code> can never be alias because they appear in different
scopes but Steensgaard's analysis does not recognize this.

But, if say, <code>bar()</code> is defined as:
<pre>
void bar() {
  int a,b;
  g = &a;
  ...
}
</pre>

Then, the analysis would still have <code>g -&gt; {a,b}</code> BUT the
<code>b</code> is the local variable from foo, not the local variable
from <code>bar</code>. (It may be easier to see this if we prepend the
names with the scopes.  Thus, <code>File_g -> {File_Bar_a,
File_Foo_b}</code>).

<p>

Actually, Steensgaard's analysis doesn't care about names.  It assigns
alias variables or types to each name and uses those during the
analysis.  The alias variables represent the alias characteristics of
the program.  Before analysis we assign the alias variables to all
globals, function names, and local variable names.
<pre>
g (global) = AV1; (AV = alias variable)
a (in bar) = AV2;
b (in foo) = AV3;
b (in bar) = AV4;
</pre>
After the analysis, we have:

<code>AV1 -&gt; {AV2, AV3}</code> (this doesn't quite follow the implementation as we have
left out some details).

<p>

Most of our optimizations don't care about names while performing
transformations.  They follow the use-def links.  In fact, the only
reason we added the name to an alias variable is for debugging.  But,
if you need to determine if two variables are aliases, then you need
to get the declaration for the variables and obtain the alias variable
for the declarations.
