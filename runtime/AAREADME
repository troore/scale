This directory tree contains the source code for the runtime library
of routines needed by the code generated by the Scale compiler.  These
routines are not referenced directly in the user's program.

There are three directories in this directory:
  libI77   - the f2c Fortran I/O routines
  libF77   - the f2c Fortran intrinsics
  libscale - wrappers for other routines

To create the runtime library, libScale_xxx.a, where xxx specifies the
target architecture, follow these steps:

  1) Define the following environmental variables:
     CC              - the C compiler to use
     SCALELIB        - the directory in which to create the library
     SCALETARGETTYPE - the target architecture, e.g., sparc, ppc.
     SCALEHOSTTYPE   - the host architecture

     You may also want to define CFLAGS.

  2) In this directory, do
      make
